2019 Memorial Day Heat Wave
=====================================

A heat wave occurred on the weekend of 2019 Memorial Day across the Southeastern U.S.

    The case runs are initialized at 00z May 23, 2019 with 120 hours forecasting. The corresponding namelist options that need to be changed are listed below. The app uses ``./xmlchange`` to change the runtime settings. The settings that need to be modified to set up the start date, start time, and run time are listed below.

    .. code-block:: bash
 
      ./xmlchange RUN_STARTDATE=2019-05-23,START_TOD=0,STOP_OPTION=nhours,STOP_N=120


    Initial condition (IC) files are created from GFS operational dataset in NEMSIO format. The `GFS reanalysis dataset <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/global-forcast-system-gfs>`_ are used as 'truth' to compare with simulation results.

  .. group-tab:: GFS.v16.0.10

    The GFS model EMC global workflow points to the most up-to-date GFS model development code. The GFS.v16.0.10 is tested in C768 (~13km) resolution and in 128 vertical levels. It uses two scripts, ``setup_expt_fcstonly.py`` and ``setup_workflow_fcstonly.py`` to set up the mode simulation date and case directories.

    The case runs are initialized at 00z May 23, 2019 with 120 hours forecasting. The settings that need to be modified to set up the start date and directories are listed below. 

    .. code-block:: bash
 
      ./setup_expt_fcstonly.py --pslot 2019MemHeat --configdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/GLOBAL/WORKFLOW/parm/config --idate 2019052300 --edate 2019052300 --res 768 --comrot /PATH/TO/YOUR/EXP/DIR/comrot --expdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/EXP/OUTPUT/expdir 

    The account and simulation duration time can be set up in ``/expdir/2019MemHeat/config.base`` file. 

    .. code-block:: bash

      ./setup_workflow_fcstonly.py --expdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/OUTPUT/expdir/2019MemHeat

    Next step is to go to ``/expdir/2019MemHeat`` to submit the run by

    .. code-block:: bash
   
      crontab 2019MemHeat.crontab

Summary and Discussion
......................

MRW_GFSv16beta generates a cold bias for 2-m temperature over most of CONUS during the 2019 Memorial Day Heat Wave event. However, both MRW.GFSv15p2 and GFS.v16.0.10 simulate the extreme temperature well over the Southeastern U.S. This means that the cold bias of this extreme temperature case in the GFS model is already fixed in the following physics developments (see `Timeline of physics frozen`_ for the different model versions).
