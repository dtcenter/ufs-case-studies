2020 Denver Radiation Inversion
=====================================
Radiation inversion usually happens at night due to the surface radiative cooling.

    The case runs are initialized at 12z Apr 29, 2020 with 120 hours forecasting. The corresponding namelist options that need to be changed are listed below. The app uses ``./xmlchange`` to change the runtime settings. The settings that need to be modified to set up the start date, start time, and run time are listed below.

    .. code-block:: bash
 
      ./xmlchange RUN_STARTDATE=2020-04-29,START_TOD=43200,STOP_OPTION=nhours,STOP_N=120


    Initial condition (IC) files are created from GFS operational dataset in NEMSIO format. Sounding profiles can be downloaded from the `University of Wyoming <http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html>`_.

  .. group-tab:: GFS.v16.0.10

    The GFS model EMC global workflow points to the most up-to-date GFS model development code. The GFS.v16.0.10 is tested in C768 (~13km) resolution and in 128 vertical levels. It uses two scripts, ``setup_expt_fcstonly.py`` and ``setup_workflow_fcstonly.py`` to set up the mode simulation date and case directories.

    The case runs are initialized at 12z Apr 29, 2020 with 120 hours forecasting. The settings that need to be modified to set up the start date and directories are listed below. 

    .. code-block:: bash
 
      ./setup_expt_fcstonly.py --pslot 2020DNRInversion --configdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/GLOBAL/WORKFLOW/parm/config --idate 2020042912 --edate 2020042912 --res 768 --comrot /PATH/TO/YOUR/EXP/DIR/comrot --expdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/EXP/OUTPUT/expdir 

    The account and simulation duration time can be set up in ``/expdir/2020DNRInversion/config.base`` file. 

    .. code-block:: bash

      ./setup_workflow_fcstonly.py --expdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/OUTPUT/expdir/2020DNRInversion

    Next step is to go to ``/expdir/2020DNRInversion`` to submit the run by

    .. code-block:: bash
   
      crontab 2020DNRInversion.crontab

Skew-T Log-P Plot
======================================================

The Skew-T Log-P plot is created using the script adapted from `SHARPpy <https://sharppy.github.io/SHARPpy/index.html>`_. The steps for using the SHARPpy scripting in Python programming language is `here <https://sharppy.github.io/SHARPpy/scripting.html>`_.

Summary and Discussion
......................

The 2020 Denver Radiation Inversion results show that the GFS model lacks skills in forecasting the boundary layer temperature inversion for MRW_GFSv15p2, MRW_GFSv16beta, and GFS.v16.0.10, with a warmer near-surface temperature.
