.. _2019 Hurricane Barry:
2019 Hurricane Barry
=====================================

Hurricane Barry made landfall in Louisiana on July 11, 2019. The peak wind speed and minimum pressure reached 72 mph and 992 hPa, respectively during the storm.

Model Configuration and Datasets
................................
.. tabs::
  .. group-tab:: MRW.v1.0

    The UFS Medium-Range Weather (MRW) Application (App) is used to prepare initial conditions, compile and run the UFS model, and post process the raw model outputs. Two model configuration compsets (``GFSv15p2`` and ``GFSv16beta``) are tested using the :emphasis:`C768` (~13km) spatial resolution with 64 vertical levels (default).

    The case runs are initialized at 00z Jul 11, 2019 with 120 hours forecasting. The app uses ``./xmlchange`` to change the runtime settings. The settings that need to be modified to set up the start date, start time, and run time are listed below.

    .. code-block:: bash
 
      ./xmlchange RUN_STARTDATE=2019-07-01,START_TOD=0,STOP_OPTION=nhours,STOP_N=120

    Initial condition (IC) files are created from GFS operational dataset in NEMSIO format. The `Stand-alone Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Vortex Tracker <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/gfdl-vortex-tracker>`_ is a tool to estimate hurricane tracks and intensities. The `Best Track dataset <https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/#hurdat>`_ provides the ‘truth’ data for hurricane evolution.

  .. group-tab:: GFS.v16.0.10

    The GFS model EMC global workflow points to the most up-to-date GFS model development code. The GFS.v16.0.10 is tested in C768 (~13km) resolution and in 128 vertical levels. It uses two scripts, ``setup_expt_fcstonly.py`` and ``setup_workflow_fcstonly.py`` to set up the mode simulation date and case directories.

    The case runs are initialized at 00z Jul 11, 2019 with 120 hours forecasting. The settings that need to be modified to set up the start date and directories are listed below. 

    .. code-block:: bash
 
      ./setup_expt_fcstonly.py --pslot Barry --configdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/GLOBAL/WORKFLOW/parm/config --idate 2019071100 --edate 2019071100 --res 768 --comrot /PATH/TO/YOUR/EXP/DIR/comrot --expdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/EXP/OUTPUT/expdir 

    The account and simulation duration time can be set up in ``/expdir/Barry/config.base`` file. 

    .. code-block:: bash

      ./setup_workflow_fcstonly.py --expdir /PATH/TO/YOUR/OUTPUT/expdir/Barry

    Next step is to go to ``/expdir/Barry`` to submit the run by

    .. code-block:: bash
   
      crontab Barry.crontab

      Hurricane tracks from MRW_GFSv16beta (red line), MRW_GFSv15p2 (blue line), and Best Track (black line). The dots are color coded with the vortex maximum 10-m wind speed (WS, kt). 

    * Both MRW_GFSv16beta and MRW_GFSv15p2 generate right-of-track bias. 
    * Hurricane track and intensity simulated by MRW_GFSv15p2 are closer to Best Track compared with MRW_GFSv16beta.

      Simulated outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at the top of atmosphere (TOA) from MRW_GFSv16beta and MRW_GFSv15p2, and infrared images from `NASA Worldview <https://worldview.earthdata.nasa.gov/>`_ at the forecast hour of 72.

    * Comparison with satellite product also indicates a right-of-track error
    * Lower OLR near the tropical cyclone (TC) center suggests more clouds in MRW_GFSv15p2 than in MRW_GFSv16beta

    * The low-level wind speed in GFS model is smaller than GFS_ANL
    * The MRW_GFSv16beta has the largest inner core size. MRW_GFS15p2 has similar inner core sizes and GFS_ANL 
    * Hurricane intensity attenuates faster in the model compared with Best Track after landfall
